## Getting Started
   
* Install JDK 8, Maven, Git, and NPM.
* Create a firebase account, and a new firebase project, with no Google Analytics.
* Enable email/password as sign in provider.
* Add a web app to the firebase project.
* Clone the frontend and backend using the following commands:
* * git clone https://github.com/Revature-Reverb/frontend.git
* * git clone https://github.com/Revature-Reverb/backend.git
* Enter the your firebase project’s web app’s settings and copy the configuration properties into the front end’s .env file.
* In the same settings, on the Service Provider tab, click on Generate new private key. Copy the contents of that key into the backend’s firebase_config.json file. 
* In backend/src/main/resources, edit the applications.property file to have the correct spring.datasource parameters to the desired database.
* Run Maven Update either within an IDE (having imported the backend as a Maven project) or using the following command in the backend directory:
* * mvn clean install -U
* Start the backend as a Spring Boot Application within an IDE or using the following command in the backend directory:
* * mvn spring-boot:run
* Install frontend dependencies using the command:
* * npm install --legacy-peer-deps
* Connect to localhost:3000 to view the webapp.

## Usage

Using the social media app should be intuitive and easy.
